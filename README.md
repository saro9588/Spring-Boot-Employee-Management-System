# Spring-Boot-Employee-Management-System

### Description
This is a full stack application to manage employees. You can Add, delete and edit employees.

### Tech Stack
I am developing the backend of this application using Spring Boot 3 framework and a locally hosted MySql database to store data in tables created using Spring Data JPA.
I will use React to create the frontend and axios to make http requests. 

### Set up
Initialize a spring boot app through the spring initializer.
Check out my pom.xml folder to add the necessary packages. 
Download and set up a MySQL database locally on your machine. 
Add your MySql db env variable to the Intelij IDE run/debug env configuration or create and add them to a .env file. 
Create a react app, install necessary packages like axios and start making calls to the backend.
